Script which shows stats from middlecoin.com

* mdc.py - a commandline client showing the info only once
* mdc2.py - a console program which updates the info periodically

Both scripts are standalone, you don't have to download both

Run the scripts with your bitcoin address as argument:

	python mdc.py 15r271ADbvPkCcENraokEzrRgLrmaSpfc8
